# Overview
This application authenticates any route with a base URL that matches foo or bar.
Each base URL accepts one set of credentails and all sub paths use the same credential

## Getting Started

1. Install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
3. Install helm: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/
4. git clone https://github.com/kapopken/kube-node-auth.git
5. Create env.yaml file in /server folder: see below
env.yaml
``` 
configuration:
 - credential: aGVsbG8=
    path: /foo
 - credential: d29ybGQ=
    path: /bar
 ```

## Project structure
```
project
│   README.md
│   Dockerfile
|   package.json
|   package-lock.json
|   .dockerignore
|   .gitignore
│
└───bin
│   │   www (This is the server spin up)
└───server
│   │   server.js (This is where middleware is injected)
│   └───views  (Location of all the rendered pages using jade)
│   └───routes (This is were all subroutes are define for a base path)
│   └───common (This is shared components and middleware)
│   └───public (Public stylesheets and assets)
└───Deployment
   │   
   └───kube-auth (Helm chart)
   │   values.yaml (overide file for helm)

```
## Development
1. Application server startup is in bin/www
2. Application server middleware is defined in server/server.js
    1. Root paths are defined here so /foo or /bar
3. Routes are defined in /server/routes

 ### To Run:
Command line:
 1. npm install (from root folder)
 2. npm start

VS Code:
  1. F5
  2. Choose node.js runner

## Deploy Setup
1. Helm chart under /deployment
2. values file to override in /deployment
3. configmap which is mounted to the container upon deployment which defines the secrets and auth

## To deploy to AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
1. helm install stable/nginx-ingress  -n auth-test-ingress --set controller.ingressClass=auth-test (** only need to be run once **)
2. cd deployment
3. Modify values.yaml file to the specific values you would like or set them via the helm install
4. helm install ./kube-auth-express -n auth-test -f values.yaml

## Master Images
1. Images are auto created from the github repository generated by Docker. They are built of the master branch
2. Images are tagged in this format version-{\1}

## Local Images
1. cd to the root of the project.
2. docker build -f Dockerfile -t {imagename} .

## Run locally from Docker
 1. cd to the root of the project
 2. docker run -p 8080:3000 -v $(pwd)/server/env.yaml:/usr/src/app/server/env.yaml {imagename}
